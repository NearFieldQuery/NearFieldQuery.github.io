        <section>
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Initiate</h3>
      <p>Tap your phone to a TAQ device to start a smart transaction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Identify</h3>
      <p>The TAQ system automatically recognizes or creates your account using your digital ID*.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Interface</h3>
      <p>Access the smart contract library and business's assets on your device**.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Input</h3>
      <p>Choose the relevant smart contract and asset(s). Transactory details are queried from the token data or inputted by the user, if necessary.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Initialize</h3>
      <p>Once you confirm the agreement, it is sent to other nodes to process and validate.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In conclusion, our system packages complex business processes into a seamless, user-friendly experience. With just a tap and minimal inputs, the transaction is executed without paperwork and profiteering middlemen, saving you time and resources. Join us in revolutionizing business automation.</p>
  <p>* A Digital ID (DiD) can be created in seconds for brand new users.</p>
  <p>** A TAQ device can be preconfigured to one contract with multiple assets or to a specific asset with multiple agreement options, depending on the situation. This step can be automatic for purely access-based scenarios or to trigger functions.</p>
